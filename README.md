# 👋 Hi, I’m Augustinas Boka — aka the pipeline guy

I build cloud-native, low-maintenance data systems that move your data without drama.  
Mostly serverless. Sometimes sassy. Always Infrastructure-as-Code.

- 🔧 Freelance Data Engineer / Consultant

- 🔄 Pipelines: Airflow, dbt, Airbyte
- 📦 Infra: Terraform, CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## ⚡️ What I Do

I specialize in:
- Data stack **migrations** (legacy → cloud)
- Building **data pipelines** tailored to requirements
- Making your infra **reproducible with Terraform**

## 📫 Let’s talk if...

- You need a **short-term project engineer** who ships fast and builds things that *don’t need babysitting*
- You're **migrating to cloud** and want to do it right
- You want someone who understands both **tech and the chaos of startup life**
- You just want to peek at weird pipeline projects
